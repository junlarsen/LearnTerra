# Frontend

The frontend is bootstrapped with Create React App.

It is built using Typescript, React and Styled Components.

## Development

Setting up the local server for the frontend is very simple.

```
npm install
npm start
```

react-scripts will take care of the rest and you'll find the site up at http://localhost:3000

## Deployment

Once again, react-scripts does all the heavy lifting for us.

```
npm run build
```

An optimized production build can now be found in `/frontend/build`.
